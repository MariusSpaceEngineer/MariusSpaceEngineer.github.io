# 🧑‍💻 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio site! This project showcases my work, blog posts, and web development skills. The site is split into two main sections:

* **Homepage** – Built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
* **Blog** – Powered by **Jekyll**, a static site generator for clean and easy-to-manage content

## 🚀 Features

* Responsive homepage with custom animations and interactions
* Blog section with clean, readable posts generated by Jekyll
* Simple and minimal design, focused on content and performance
* Deployed using GitHub Pages
* 

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Vanilla)
* Jekyll (for blog content)

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-portfolio.git
   cd your-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install Jekyll (for blog)**
   Make sure you have Ruby and Bundler installed, then run:
